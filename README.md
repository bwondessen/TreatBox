# TreatBox - Fetch iOS Coding Challenge

## A native iOS app written in SwiftUI that uses TheMealDB's API (https://themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch and display desserts and its details!

This app displays a list of desserts and when a user selects a dessert, they are taken to a detail view that includes: meal name, instructions, and ingredients/measurements. Users can bookmark/unbookmark recipes and it'll save to the bookmarks tab. Additionally, when a user selects a bookmarked recipe, it'll take them to a detail view.

* Core Data (data persistence)
* Image caching
* Unit testing
* API calls
* Thread safety 
* MVVM architecture
